In FOLIO, metadata management includes essential cataloging functions. These functions include:

- Creating Instance, Holdings, and Item records
- Managing your collections (physical and/or virtual)
- Importing and exporting bibliographic data
- Editing MARC records

## Cataloging Settings

Metadata management is governed by a set of rules and policies. These rules and policies are defined by the library and implemented in the Data export, Data import, and [Inventory](../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/) areas of the FOLIO Settings app.
