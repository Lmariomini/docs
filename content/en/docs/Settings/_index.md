In FOLIO, settings are configured to help customize apps according to each institution's unique needs. Many apps have associated settings in the Settings app, some of which are required and some of which are optional. However, some apps do not have explicitly associated settings.  

Some of the settings in the Settings app have effects across multiple apps.  For example, if your institution chooses to define acquisition units, those units can be used as a search parameter in multiple apps.
