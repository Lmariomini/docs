The Calendar section of the Settings app is where you edit open and closed hours for the library service points. 

The Check out app references the logged-in userâ€™s service point when loaning items to patrons and calculating their due dates. That means that the service point must have an existing calendar that covers the time period that the item could potentially be loaned for in order for the check out to be successful.

The Calendar section of Settings allows you to create a new calendar, edit existing calendars, duplicate existing calendars, and delete calendars. You can create a single calendar and assign it to multiple service points.

## Permissions

* **Settings (Calendar): Can view existing calendars**. This permission allows a user to open **Settings \> Calendar** and view the three options: **All calendars**, **Current calendar assignments**, and **Monthly calendar view**.
* **Settings (Calendar): Can create and assign new calendars**. This permission grants a user the view permissions in **Settings (Calendar): Can view existing calendars.** In addition, in **All calendars**, the user can select **Actions \> New**, create a new calendar, and assign it to one or more service points. In **Current calendar assignments**, the user can select **New** and create a new calendar and assign it to one or more service points. They can also choose a service point with a calendar assignment and choose **Actions \> Duplicate**
* **Settings (Calendar): Can edit and reassign existing calendars**.

## Settings > Calendar > All calendars

Use this option to see all calendars on your system (including those with end dates in the past) and what service points those calendars were/are assigned to.

From here, a user with appropriate permissions can use the Actions menu to edit and/or duplicate an existing calendar, create a brand new calendar, or delete a calendar

## Settings > Calendar > Current calendar assignments

Use this option to see only calendars that are currently in effect for each service point in your FOLIO instance.

From here, you can click **New** to create a brand new calendar to assign to a service point.

## Settings > Calendar > Monthly calendar view

Use this option to view the service point calendar for the current month. You can use the arrows to go to different months, including reviewing past calendars.

## Creating a new calendar

To create a new calendar, go to **All calendars**. 

1. Select **Actions \> New**. 
2. Enter a **Calendar name**. 
3. Enter a **Start date** and **End date**.
4. Select one or more **Service points** to assign the calendar to. You can also leave this option blank, and assign the calendar to a service point later.

Next, you will add your service point hours.

Hours are represented on the calendar as a table, each row representing a slot of **Hours of operation** - a period when the service point opened for service, and then closed. 

If a service point opens on one day and then does not close until a future day, the **Start day** and **End day** of a particular row may be different days. This may happen if, for example, a library remains open overnight for students studying for final exams.

If a library's standard hours include a day when it is completely closed, it is recommended that you still set a row for that day, and just designate the status as closed. For example, if a library is always closed on Sundays, you would represent that day with a row with a status of **Closed**, a **Start day** of Sunday, and an **End day** of Sunday.

To add **Hours of operation**:

1. From **Status**, choose **Open** or **Closed**. 
2. Choose the start day for your **Hours of operation** time slot.
3. Choose the **Start time** when the service point opens. If the **Status** of the row is Closed, you do not set a start time.
4. Choose the **End day** when the service point closes. If your library remains open after 11:59 PM, your end day will be different than your start day.
5. Choose the **End time** when the service point closes. If the **Status** of the row is Closed, you do not set an end time.
6. Click **Add row** to add additional rows as needed.
7. When you are finished adding your hours of operation, click **Save and close** at the bottom to save your calendar.
