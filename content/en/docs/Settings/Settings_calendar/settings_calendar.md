The Calendar section of the Settings app is where you edit open and closed hours for the library service points. 

The Check out app references the logged-in userâ€™s service point when loaning items to patrons and calculating their due dates. That means that the service point must have an existing calendar that covers the time period that the item could potentially be loaned for in order for the check out to be successful.

The Calendar section of Settings allows you to create a new calendar, edit existing calendars, duplicate existing calendars, and delete calendars. You can create a single calendar and assign it to multiple service points.

## Permissions

To interact with Settings > Calendar, a user needs to be assigned at least one of the following permission: 

* **Settings (Calendar): Can view calendar events.** This permission allows the user to view calendar events.
* **Settings (Calendar): Can create, view, edit, and remove calendar events.** This permission allows the user to create, view, edit, and remove calendar events.
* **Settings (Calendar): Can create, view, and edit calendar events.** This permission allows the user to create, view, and edit calendar events.

## Settings > Calendar > All calendars

Use this option to see all calendars on your system (including those with end dates in the past) and what service points those calendars were assigned too.

From here you can use the Action menu to edit and/or duplicate an existing calendar, or create a brand new calendar.

## Settings > Calendar > Current calendar assignments

Use this option to see only calendars that are currently in effect for each service point in your FOLIO instance.

From here, you can click **New** to create a brand new calendar to assign to a service point.

## Settings > Calendar > Monthly calendar view

Use this option to view the service point calendar for the current month. You can use the arrows to go to different months, including reviewing past calendars.
