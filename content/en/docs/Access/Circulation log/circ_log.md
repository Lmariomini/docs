The Circulation log app allows you to view and search for circulation actions. Circulation actions are any action performed by the system or a user within the following Circulation apps: Check in, Check out, and Requests. Notices and fee/fine actions are also included.


## Permissions

In order to view and interact with the Circulation log app, a user needs to be assigned the following permission:

* **Circulation log: All.** This permission allows the user to access the circulation log and filter all log actions and data.

Note: This is the only permission available for the Circulation log app. You are unable to view and access the Circulation log if you do not have this permission assigned to you. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app.


## Generating a circulation log

You can generate a log based on any of the query parameters or filters you select.

Note: Panes are resizable throughout FOLIO and in the Circulation log. Resize the **Search & filter** pane to see more or less of the circulation log at once.

## Exporting circulation log search results

If your search for circulation log records returns results, you can export those results to a CSV file.
