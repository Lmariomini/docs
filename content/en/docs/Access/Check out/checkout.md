The Check Out app enables a patron to borrow an item.  To check out an item, first locate the patron in the system and then scan/enter the item to borrow.

## Locating the patron in the system

You can find the patron by either:

* Scanning / entering the barcode provided by the patron
* Using the Patron Look-up function

1. Either scan the barcode on the patron's library card, or enter the patron barcode number.
2. Click **Enter**. Patron details are displayed.


Locate the patron using the Patron Lookup function:

1. In the Scan Patron Card paneclick **Patron Look-up**. 
2. In the **Select User** dialog, enter part or all of the patron's name, email or username.
3. Optional: Filter results by status (active/inactive), or by patron type.
4. Click **Search**.
5. Click the patron to use. The Select User screen closes, the barcode appears in the Scan Patron Card area, and the patron details are displayed.

### Assessing the patron's data

Within the patron details area, note that you can access additional information related to the user.  Clicking on any linked information opens the appropriate app and displays the associated information.  For example, clicking the number beneath Open requests opens the Requests app.
