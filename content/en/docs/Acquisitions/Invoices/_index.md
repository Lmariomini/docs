The Invoices app allows you to manage payment for the materials that your library ordered. You can also search for and edit existing invoices as needed.

Definitions of terms used in the Invoices app:



*   **Accounting code.** The code used by your library in your payment system in reference to an organization.
*   **Acquisitions units.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Adjustments.** Charges added to an invoice in addition to the materials ordered. Shipping costs and exchange rates represent common adjustments.
*   **Batch group.** Groups that process their invoices together. Invoices from the same library are generally processed together.
*   **Funds.** Specific allocations of money within a ledger.
*   **Invoice lines.** The individual line items being paid for within each invoice. Each line consists of a description of the materials being paid for, the costs incurred, and a vendor reference number. Invoices are primarily a sum of the information from these lines.
*   **Organizations.** Any institution with whom your library interacts (this may or may not be an institution from whom you purchase materials).
*   **Vendor.** Any institution from whom your library purchases materials.
*   **Vendor invoice number.** The number provided by the vendor for this invoice.
*   **Voucher number.** A number generated by the system to identify the payment request exported from FOLIO to an external financial system.

## Deleting an invoice

2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, click **Actions** > **Delete**.
3. In the Delete invoice dialog, click **Delete**. A confirmation message appears and the invoice is deleted.


## Approving an invoice

Invoices require approval before the payment amounts are considered to be awaiting payment and in order for vouchers to be created. Only invoices with invoice lines can be approved. Only someone with the Approve invoice permission can perform this action. Note: Once one or more invoices connected to a purchase order line have been “Approved,” the payment status on the purchase order is changed to “Partially paid.”

If entering a locked total, all invoice lines and adjustment values must equal this lock total amount before a user can approve the invoice. Approving an invoice triggers the creation of the voucher and pending payment transactions. Vouchers are a mechanism for providing the information necessary to make invoice payments and can be exported to an external payment system. Each invoice generates a single unique voucher on which all fund charges are grouped by the fund external account number. For more information on exporting vouchers, see
 [Settings > Invoices > Batch group configuration]({{< ref "/settings_invoices.md#settings--invoices--batch-group-configuration" >}}).

To approve an invoice, follow these steps:



1. Find the invoice you want to approve and select it.
2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, click **Actions** > **Approve.**
3. In the **Approve invoice** dialog, click **Approve**. A confirmation message appears and the invoice is approved.

## Viewing a voucher


Once an invoice is approved, an invoice voucher is created and is added to the invoice record.  To view an invoice voucher, follow these steps:



1. Using the **Search and Filter** pane, find the invoice you want to view and select it.
2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, scroll down to the **Voucher information** section.  Key information about the invoice payment voucher is displayed in this section.
3. To view all voucher information on a full screen window, click **View voucher**.

*   **Enclosure needed.**  If true and payment method is “Check,” this indicates to an external accounting system that an enclosure is needed with this invoice,If the Export to accounting checkbox is set to true and a voucher is created for this invoice, the export voucher file will contain a value of true for

*   **External account number.**  The fund’s external account number.
*   **Total.** The total amount for all voucher lines, displayed at the bottom of the voucher line table.


The Voucher lines table contains this information for each voucher line:

*   **Amount.**



## Paying an invoice



Use the Pay action to update the invoice to the status of Paid. The Pay action is available in the Action menu if the Settings > Invoices > Approvals > Approve and pay in one click setting is turned off.  This enables a library to use separate actions to approve invoices and pay invoices.  If that setting is off, the invoice must be approved before the Pay action is available.  Moving the invoice to paid status triggers an update of the order status to Closed if the order is fully received. See [Settings > Invoices > Approvals]({{< ref "/invoices.md#settings--invoices--approvals" >}})  for more information about the Approve and pay in one click setting.  



To pay an invoice, follow these steps:



1. Using the **Search and Filter** pane, find the invoice you want to pay and select it.
2. In the **Action** menu, select **Pay**.



## Viewing voucher export details and downloading the export file



The process to generate a batch file containing vouchers for export to an external accounts payable system is managed in [Invoice > Settings > Batch group configuration]({{< ref "/invoices.md#settings--invoices--batch-group-configuration" >}}).  Only vouchers for invoices with the Export to accounting checkbox turned on with an invoice status of “Approved” that have not been extracted in a prior job run will be included in the export.  After the export job completes, you can view details about the export and view a copy of the full voucher export file by finding an invoice that was included in the export job.
