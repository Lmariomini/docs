The Invoices app allows you to manage payment for the materials that your library ordered. You can also search for and edit existing invoices as needed. 

Definitions of terms used in the Invoices app: 



*   **Accounting code.** The code used by your library in your payment system in reference to an organization. 
*   **Acquisitions units.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Adjustments:** Charges added to an invoice in addition to the materials ordered. Shipping costs and exchange rates represent common adjustments. 
*   **Batch group:** Groups that process their invoices together. Invoices from the same library are generally processed together. 
*   **Funds:** Specific allocations of money within a ledger.
*   **Invoice lines:** The individual line items being paid for within each invoice. Each line consists of a description of the materials being paid for, the costs incurred, and a vendor reference number. Invoices are primarily a sum of the information from these lines. 
*   **Organizations:** Any institution with whom your library interacts (this may or may not be an institution from whom you purchase materials).
*   **Vendor:** Any institution from whom your library purchases materials. 
*   **Vendor invoice number.** The number provided by the vendor for this invoice.
